                <h2>The discovery</h2>
                <p>The first time I discovered Lacrosse was in the fourth grade. 
                 My gym teacher gave me a flyer and said "You need to try Lacrosse".
                 I went later that to try Lacrosse and it was love at first sight.

                <h2>Through The Struggles</h2>
                <p>Up until high school I has a lot of friends that weren't the best influences,
                 with the help of lacrosse I found out who i can really trust. This sport guided me to be who I've become to this day.
                 If I hadn't continued with lacrosse my friend group would've never changed for the better. 
                 I found friends that soon became as close as brothers thanks to this sport.

                <h2>The How</h2>
                <p>Lacrosse has altered my life for the better. 
                    It proves to me when you are down in life or the game to keep fighting. 
                    Lacrosse brings people together teaches them how to keep going, and the end of the game is really never the end.
